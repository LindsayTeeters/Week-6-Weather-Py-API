# Week 6 Challenge

## Overview
Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. We were asked to tweek the app a bit to upgrade it to the next level. It was suggested that they would like to add weather description to the weather data within the app. We needed to update the code and generated the needed outcome of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the Opwn WeatherMap. Once this was completed, we entered input statements to retreieve customer weather preferences and then identify nearby hotels. The last thing needed was to show the travel itinerary.

## Results
I set the size of the data retreival for cities to 2,000. This successfully generated 767 cities. A table was generated with the requested columns. The requested weather details were added to the last columns.
